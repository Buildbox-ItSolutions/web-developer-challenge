# Buildbox

Hello!

This is my submission for the buildbox test.
I had a lot of fun making this project and I hope you like!

### Technologies used 🧑🏼‍💻

React.js, Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind, Heroku, Postgres.

I decided to use Tailwind for styling because I can easily make the website responsive and style the components very fast. I was tempted to use Styled Components, but for small projects like that I prefer Tailwind.

I used Heroku and Postgres to create a database to store the posts, and for managing it in the frontend I used Prisma and Next.js. Prisma makes the process of working with databases really easy and I just love using it.

### Running locally

To run the project locally you just need to do a clone of the repository, run 'yarn' and then 'yarn dev'.
